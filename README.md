This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

üåÄ About Zeroglyph
By Timoteo Alves Cruz

I didn‚Äôt leave mathematics. I just stepped outside the classroom.

For four years, I studied mathematics at the Federal University of Sergipe. I was a good student‚Äîcurious, committed, and passionate. But somewhere along the way, the joy began to fade. The lectures became drills. Proofs were rehearsed performances. Questions were discouraged because ‚Äúthey would delay the course.‚Äù Math was taught like a tool for engineers, not a language of wonder.

One day, after presenting a proof, my professor said: ‚ÄúHere you need to come trained. There is no time to construct the solution.‚Äù That was the moment I realized: there was no room to build, only to repeat.

So I walked away‚Äîfrom my degree, from my lifelong passion. But not from mathematics.

I turned to programming, my other love. I dove into OpenGL, C++, and eventually discovered a new rendering technique‚Äîone I still keep under wraps. And in that moment of discovery, something stirred. It was math, tapping me on the shoulder, whispering: ‚ÄúI miss you. How are you doing?‚Äù

That whisper became a calling.

I remembered a promise I once made to myself: To reconstruct mathematics from the beginning. Not from textbooks, but from the lived experience of discovery. Not from definitions, but from questions. Not from authority, but from curiosity.

Thus, Zeroglyph was born.

A blog, a channel, a journey. A place where we follow the story of Taro and Otaru, two wanderers who rediscover mathematics from scratch‚Äîstarting with tally marks on cave walls, and building all the way to the abstract towers of set theory and topology.

This is not a course. It‚Äôs a quest. A retelling of math as it could be taught: Through stories, adventures, and philosophical wonder. Through mistakes, insights, and the joy of building something true.

If you‚Äôve ever felt that math was more than formulas‚Äî If you‚Äôve ever wanted to feel mathematics, not just study it‚Äî Then come walk with me.

Let‚Äôs rediscover math together. Let‚Äôs make it human again.
